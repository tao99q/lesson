    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Our vision has always been to do the best work possible for our clients. What has changed is the ways we can achieve that. We’ve been a digitally-focused agency from the start, so we’ve had the opportunity to watch as digital evolved and evolve alongside it. And no matter where the industry has gone, we’ve used each new innovation as a way to better connect our clients with their consumers.</p>

    <p>Digital advertising is a completely different animal than it was when we began. It’s not just that technology has changed, but the ways that brands use technology to connect with consumers has changed, as has the nature of the basic brand-consumer relationship. </p>
